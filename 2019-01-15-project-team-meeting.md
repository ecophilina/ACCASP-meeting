# Meeting objectives

Ensure everyone has an up-to-date understanding of the project objectives as defined in the ACCASP Proposal and the current status of this project.

Build familiarity with each other's strengths and expertise.

Use open discussion to establish a concensus around the high-level approaches that will be applied in implementing this project.

Define publishable units and ways to make results relevent to DFO science and fisheries management.

Become familiar with each team member's interest, available time to devote to this project, and goals in terms of authorship. 

Assess progress towards stated project milestones and set a draft timetable going forward.

Brainstorm list of potential technical break-out group tasks.

Work in teams to complete group tasks, thus establishing collaborative understanding and hopefully clearing some key analytical or conceptual hurdles. 


# Meeting agenda

## Day 1: Monday, January 21st 2019

* Welcome and review of objectives and agenda. 

* Quick round of introductions.

* An overview of the ACCASP project proposal [Sean]

* Short review of recent literature [Philina]

* Team presentations introducing themselves and their related work
    - Eric Ward 
    - Chris Rooper
    - Karen Hunter
    - Brendan Connors
    - Andy Edwards
    - Robyn Forrest [by proxy]
    - Sean Anderson

### Break for lunch

* Review of stated deliverables and timeline

* High-level discussion of how to achieve project objectives:
    - Start with free idea sharing (<5 min) 
    - Provide oppertunity for idea refinement, clarification, and discussion of broad conceptual approaches 
    - Discuss goal of eventual integration into stock assessments 
    - Discuss if these models could impact our understanding of changes in productivity and dispersal
    - Discuss how to define publishable units
    
* Technical discussion of how to achieve project objectives:
      1. Should synoptic survey blocks be treated separately, or somehow stitched together?
	    2. Which modeling framework and plateform should we use? Frequentist TMB vs. Bayesian INLA or STAN.
	    3. Should we attempt to use other survey data: IPHC, HBLL(inside and outside), sablefish?
	     - Which environmental variables do these other surveys collect? 
	    4. How do we model all 3 spatial dimensions of climate velocity (lat, lon, and depth) and variables (temp, salinity, O2)?
	    5. Are centre of gravity and area of occupancy appropriate response variables for Canadian waters?  
	     - If so, how best do we calculate them?
	    6. How should we deal with size structure of populations?
	    7. Should we consider multi-species covariance (e.g.. spatial dynamic factor analysis in TMB)?
	  
* Free wheeling discussion of ideas for topics for breakout groups
    - Possibilities include: 
      1. How to implement a random walk for environmental covariates (time varying quadratic effects of O2, temp, depth and salinity)?
	    2. How to calculate centre of gravity and area of occupancy?
	    3. Plan best Visualizations for expected patterns
    - Choose priorities and who should tackle which problem


## Day 2: Tuesday, January 22nd 2019

* Welcome back and review of breakout group objectives

* Breakout group work (remainder of the morning)

### Break for lunch

* Discussion of results of morning's group work

* Additional shorter breakout group work session (until ~3pm)

* Wrap-up 

    - Review project objectives, deliverables and timeline in light of days acheivements
    - Discuss each team member's interests, availability, and desired roles 
    - Set goals and guidelines for on-going collaboration
    - Review key conclusions from both discussions and breakout group work

# Authorship agreement

We will adopt the authorship guidelines from the Nutrient Network research consortium, which specifies that one must meet at least two of the criteria in the table below to qualify for authorship on any given paper. Expectations for our authorship agreement include additional participation as requested by the leads of each paper, including but not limited to timely comments and edits on the manuscripts themselves. All authors will be asked to state how they plan to contribute to each paper moving forward and this information will be kept in a file shared with all participants. Additional authors will be invited based on need of their expertise. Final decisions on authorship are up to the lead of each paper and workshop chairs.
