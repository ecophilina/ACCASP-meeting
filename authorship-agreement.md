**Authorship agreement:**

We will adopt the authorship guidelines from the Nutrient Network
research consortium, which specifies that one must meet at least two of
the criteria in the table below to qualify for authorship on any given
paper. Expectations for our authorship agreement include additional
participation as requested by the leads of each paper, including but not
limited to timely comments and edits on the manuscripts themselves. All
authors will be asked to state how they plan to contribute to each paper
moving forward and this information will be kept in a file shared with
all participants (this will be completed while at the workshop).
Additional authors will be invited based on need of their expertise.
Final decisions on authorship are up to the lead of each paper and
workshop chairs.
